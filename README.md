# Credit Risk Dashboard – Tableau Final Project

This project is a credit risk visualization built in Tableau as part of my graduate coursework. It explores risk segmentation and loss exposure using a simplified PD (Probability of Default) model due to limited data availability. ( you will need the Tableau app to view the file )

## 📂 File
- `Final_Project_Edward_Asante_4.30.25.twbx`: Tableau workbook file containing all dashboards, worksheets, and data connections.

## 🧠 Project Objective
The aim of this project was to:
- Simulate expected credit loss using a fixed PD rate.
- Visualize portfolio exposure by customer segment, region, and risk score.
- Build an intuitive Tableau dashboard that decision-makers can use for risk insights.

## ⚙️ Approach
- Used Tableau to load and visualize credit data.
- Applied a **fixed PD rate** as a proxy due to the lack of granular default history.
- Built interactive views to display risk tiers, loss distribution, and portfolio exposure.

## 📸 Dashboard Features
- **Risk Heatmaps**: Visual breakdown by region and risk band.
- **Loss Forecasting**: Estimated Expected Loss using fixed PD × LGD × EAD logic.
- **Interactive Filters**: Explore metrics by customer type, time period, and geography.

## 📈 Tools Used
- Tableau (Desktop)
- Excel (for initial data prep)
